# Rocket Design Final Project

### Overview
This project revolves around the design and proposal of a low-cost, reusable rocket capable of deploying a 1,000 kg satellite into a 500 km altitude low-Earth orbit. The endeavor is part of an initiative to establish a network of small satellites for global satellite internet coverage. Each team, comprising six students, is tasked with developing an independent design to meet the specified goal effectively.

### Project Details
- **Venture Objective**: A group of venture capitalists seeks to fund the deployment of small satellites for global satellite internet coverage.
- **Design Objective**: Create a low-cost, reusable rocket with a reusable first stage capable of placing a 1,000 kg satellite into a 500 km altitude low-Earth orbit.
- **Project Guidelines**:
  1. Teams have autonomy in selecting propellants.
  2. Rockets may feature one, two, or three stages, in series or parallel, with only the first stage being reusable.
  3. Cost calculations are based on specific equations considering factors like launch mass and payload mass fraction.
  4. Theoretical frameworks such as ideal rocket theory and ideal gas theory are applicable.
  5. Total Î”v of the mission is set at 9.0 km/sec, inclusive of drag and gravitational losses.
  6. Material selection for construction, combustion chambers, and propellant tanks is at each team's discretion.
  7. Teams must adhere to technological feasibility and refrain from using "unobtainium" materials.
  8. Physical and chemical properties of selected propellants must be determined, and various performance parameters computed.
  9. The CEARUN code is recommended for combustion computations.
  10. Material selection for combustion chambers and solid rocket casings is based on expected combustion temperatures.
  11. For liquid propellant systems, teams must address issues related to propellant delivery, injector design, and pressure drops.
  12. Design must be original; copying existing launch vehicles is prohibited.
  13. Collaboration with other teams or external parties is prohibited; consultation with the course instructor or TA is allowed.

### Deliverables
- **Final Report Due Date**: Friday, March 15 at 11:59pm
- **Final Presentations**: Monday, March 11 from 8:30-10:20am

This project constitutes 40% of the final grade and serves as the final exam for the course "AA462 Rocket Propulsion Winter 2024."
